# Advertising Sales Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression 

Advertising Sales Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression is a data analysis project that aims to predict sales based on advertising spending using multiple linear regression. The project involves using a dataset that contains information on advertising spending on TV, radio, and newspaper, as well as the corresponding sales figures.

The steps involved in this project include:

1. Data Collection: Collecting the required data for the project, either through publicly available sources or by conducting surveys or experiments.

2. Data Cleaning: Cleaning and processing the collected data to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and consistent. This step may involve removing outliers, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between the variables. EDA can involve visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

4. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from the existing ones to improve the performance of the model. This step may involve transforming variables, creating interaction terms, and selecting relevant features.

5. Model Selection: Selecting the appropriate model for the data. In this case, multiple linear regression is used to predict sales based on advertising spending.

6. Model Training: Fitting the selected model to the data using techniques such as ordinary least squares (OLS) or gradient descent.

7. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as R-squared, mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

8. Model Deployment: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data. This step involves deploying the model in a production environment.

In conclusion, Advertising-Sales-Prediction-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression is a data analysis project that involves predicting sales based on advertising spending using multiple linear regression. The project involves several steps, including data collection, cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.
